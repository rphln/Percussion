# ü•Å Percussion

Percussion is a command framework for [Nostrum]. It is based on the concept of
transformation pipelines for command requests, being loosely inspired by Plug.

## About the pipeline.

Chaining functions is the main way dealing with command requests (i.e., calls) in
Percussion.

The pipeline is composed of a list of steps that are called in order, which are simply
request to request functions:

```elixir
def ping(request) do
  reply(request, "Pong!")
end
```

Additionally, steps have the ability to stop the whole pipeline prematurely by calling
`Percussion.Request.halt/1` on the request; this may be used, for example, to handle
errors that occur in the middle of the pipeline process.

## Installation

At this moment, Percussion is highly volatile; if you're feeling adventurous and want to
try it, simply add it as a GitHub dependency.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:percussion, github: "BlindJoker/Percussion"}
  ]
end
```
